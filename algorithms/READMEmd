Use of the Algorithms:

Algorithms play a crucial role in various fields and have many applications. Some of the key areas where algorithms are used include:

    1. Computer Science: Algorithms form the basis of computer programming and are used to solve problems ranging from simple sorting and 
        searching to complex tasks such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
    2. Mathematics: Algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems, such as finding the optimal solution to a system of linear equations or
        finding the shortest path in a graph.
    3. Operations Research: Algorithms are used to optimize and make decisions in fields such as transportation, logistics, and resource 
        allocation.
    4. Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms are the foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and are used to develop 
        intelligent systems that can perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.
    5. Data Science: Algorithms are used to analyze, process, and extract insights from large amounts of data in fields such as marketing, 
        finance, and healthcare.

What is the need for algorithms?

    1. Algorithms are necessary for solving complex problems efficiently and effectively. 
    2. They help to automate processes and make them more reliable, faster, and easier to perform.
    3. Algorithms also enable computers to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.
    4. They are used in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, engineering, finance, and many others to optimize processes,  
        analyze data, make predictions, and provide solutions to problems.

Properties of Algorithm:

    It should terminate after a finite time.
    It should produce at least one output.
    It should take zero or more input.
    It should be deterministic means giving the same output for the same input case.
    Every step in the algorithm must be effective i.e. every step should do some work.

Types of Algorithm:
    1. Brute Force : It is the simplest approach to a problem. A brute force algorithm is the first approach that comes to finding when we see a problem.
    2. Recursive Algorithm: A recursive algorithm is based on recursion. In this case, a problem is broken into several sub-parts and called the same function again and again.
    3. Back-Tracking Algorithm: The backtracking algorithm builds the solution by searching among all possible solutions. Using this algorithm, we keep on building the solution following criteria. Whenever a solution fails we trace back to the failure point build on the next solution and continue this process till we find the solution or all possible solutions are looked after.
    4. Searching Algorithm: Sorting is arranging a group of data in a particular manner according to the requirement. The algorithms which help in performing this function are called sorting algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort groups of data in an increasing or decreasing manner.
    5. Hashing Algorithm: Hashing algorithms work similarly to the searching algorithm. But they contain an index with a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data.
    6. Divide and Conquer: This algorithm breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves a single sub-problem, and merges the solutions to get the final solution. It consists of the following three steps:
            Divide
            Solve
            Combine
    7. Sorting Algorithm: Sorting is arranging a group of data in a particular manner according to the requirement. The algorithms which help in performing this function are called sorting algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort groups of data in an increasing or decreasing manner.
    8. Greedy Algorithm: In this type of algorithm, the solution is built part by part. The solution for the next part is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part. The one solution that gives the most benefit will be chosen as the solution for the next part.
    9. Dynamic Programming Algorithm: This algorithm uses the concept of using the already found solution to avoid repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem. It divides the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves them.
    10: Randomized Algorithm: This algorithm uses the concept of using the already found solution to avoid repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem. It divides the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves them.


Advantages of Algorithms:
    1. It is easy to understand.
    2. An algorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem.
    3. In an Algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, it is easier for the programmer to convert it into an actual program.

Disadvantages of Algorithms:

    1. Writing an algorithm takes a long time so it is time-consuming.
    2. Understanding complex logic through algorithms can be very difficult.
    3. Branching and Looping statements are difficult to show in Algorithms(imp).


How to Design an Algorithm?

To write an algorithm, the following things are needed as a pre-requisite: 

    1. The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm i.e. clear problem definition.
    2. The constraints of the problem must be considered while solving the problem.
    3. The input to be taken to solve the problem.
    4. The output is to be expected when the problem is solved.
    5. The solution to this problem is within the given constraints.
