Generally, there is always more than one way to solve a problem in computer science with different algorithms. Therefore, it is highly required to use a method to compare the solutions in order to judge which one is more optimal. The method must be:

    Independent of the machine and its configuration, on which the algorithm is running on.
    Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.
    Can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity.


What is Algorithm complexity and how to find it?

An algorithm is defined as complex based on the amount of Space and Time it consumes. Hence the Complexity of an algorithm refers to the measure of the time that it will need to execute and get the expected output, and the Space it will need to store all the data (input, temporary data, and output). Hence these two factors define the efficiency of an algorithm.
The two factors of Algorithm Complexity are:

    1. Time Factor: Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.
    2. Space Factor: Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm to run/execute.

Therefore the complexity of an algorithm can be divided into two types: 
    1. Space Complexity 
    2. Time Complexity
